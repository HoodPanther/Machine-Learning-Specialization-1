###Regression:
Case Study - Predicting Housing Prices

######Certificate: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/DATJNQFE3QHN
In our first case study, predicting house prices, I created models that predicts a continuous value (price) from input features (square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms,...).  

In this course, we explored regularized linear regression models for the task of prediction and feature selection.  We handled very large sets of features and select between models of various complexity.  We also analyzed the impact of aspects of data -- such as outliers -- on your selected models and predictions.  To fit these models, I implemented optimization algorithms that scale to large datasets.

####Work done
* Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.
* Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.
* Tune parameters with cross validation.
* Analyze the performance of the model.
* Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.
* Deploy methods to select between models.
* Exploit the model to form predictions. 
* Build a regression model to predict prices using a housing dataset.
* Implement these techniques in Python.


###Classification:
Case Studies: Analyzing Sentiment & Loan Default Prediction

Data set:
          *Amazon review database consisting 183531 entries 
          *Lending club data sub-set consisting of 122607 entries

In this case study on analyzing sentiment,I created models that predicted a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).  In our second case study for this course, loan default prediction, we tackled financial data, and predicted when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank. 

####Work done
* Tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems.
* Implement a logistic regression model for large-scale classification.  
* Create a non-linear model using decision trees.
* Improve the performance of any model using boosting.
* Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.
* Describe the underlying decision boundaries.  
* Build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset.  
* Analyze financial data to predict loan defaults.
* Use techniques for handling missing data.
* Evaluate your models using precision-recall metrics.
* Implemented these techniques in Python
